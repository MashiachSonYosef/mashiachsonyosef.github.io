# Route Publication Boundary Audit

Generated: 2026-06-01T01:46:23.780Z

## Boundary

- `answer_eligible` means the route card can be considered for the HUD answer slot.
- `answer_eligible` is not accepted translation-output readiness.
- Publication readiness must come from a later renderer/translation gate, not from this route lookup.

## Unsafe For Accepted Translation Output
