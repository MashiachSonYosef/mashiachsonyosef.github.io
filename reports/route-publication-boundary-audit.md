# Route Publication Boundary Audit

Generated: 2026-06-01T04:56:25.786Z

## Boundary

- `answer_eligible` means the route card can be considered for the HUD answer slot.
- `answer_eligible` is not accepted translation-output readiness.
- Publication readiness must come from a later renderer/translation gate, not from this route lookup.

## Unsafe For Accepted Translation Output

These rows may still be valid HUD route evidence, but they are not automatically safe as accepted translation-output support without downstream attribution/license handling.
